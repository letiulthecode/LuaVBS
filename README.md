# Lua VBS
    LuaVBS its an library that "converts" lua to vbs

    Any function it will write into a .vbs file
# Why LuaVBS
    1- An easy way to create GUIs

    2- Has a decent error handler

    3- Can concat with lua values! (because its a file af)
# Weaknesses
    1-The code its mega trash

    2-Is (kinda) buggy

    3-VBS Just works on windows (You can install wine and this problem resolves i guess.)
